<h1 id="title">kayrayi sikerim</h1>
<pre id="title">
    In a playful escape, I ducked my cousin's grasp,
    Swift as a breeze, I slipped through fingers clasp.
    With a wink and a giggle, I danced out of reach,
    Leaving behind laughter and mirth in each.
    
    Through the room we frolicked, a game we both knew,
    Ducking and dodging, like birds in sky blue.
    With every near capture, my heart skipped a beat,
    A cousinly bond, an adventure so sweet.
    
    In that moment of triumph, I embraced my glee,
    The joy of connection, forever a treasured memory.  </pre>
